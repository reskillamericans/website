When I think about where I was last March and where I am now as a Frontend Web Developer, it's like night and day: I went from learning basic Git from Mike Koss to running my own project. It's been a wonderful journey. Don't get me wrong, it was difficult, but well worth it. We were taught by a dedicated team of instructors and mentors and were given unfiltered access to board members. Throughout the program, we were pushed to work hard and encouraged to do it as a community. I am humbled by and thankful for the experience.",
