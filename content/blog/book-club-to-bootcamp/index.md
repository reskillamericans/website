Femi Akinde and Mike Koss met a decade ago at StartPad, a former Seattle
co-working space where Koss was director and Akinde was a startup founder. They
both eventually moved on, but stayed in close contact. They had monthly lunches
and started a social justice book club to discuss the Black experience.

But as the COVID-19 pandemic drove Black and Brown unemployment numbers
disturbingly high and more companies pledged to increase their workplace
diversity in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, they decided that talk
wasnâ€™t enough. They needed to take action.
