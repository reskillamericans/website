# Help Us Increase Access to Careers in Tech

When you partner with Reskill Americans, you help underrepresented minorities
get started on a career path in tech, and ultimately, contribute to long-term
economic advancement.

Our partners enable us to deliver our tuition-free software development
training, mentorship and community to our participants. We also seek companies
to hire our participants into entry-level jobs or paid internships at the end
our program.

## Volunteers

We seek volunteers, ideally software developers or UI/UX product designers, to
engage with -- and/or mentor -- our participants throughout our seven-month
program.

Our participants are determined, driven and committed to learning what's
required to get a job in the tech industry. They often have extensive experience
in other industries, and some have graduate degrees.

  your tech skills.
