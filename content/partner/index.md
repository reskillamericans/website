# Help Us Increase Access to Careers in Tech

When you partner with Reskill Americans, you help underrepresented minorities
get started on a career path in tech, and ultimately, contribute to long-term
economic advancement.

Our partners enable us to deliver our tuition-free software development
training, mentorship and community to our participants. We also seek companies
to hire our participants into entry-level jobs or paid internships at the end
our program.

## Volunteers

We seek volunteers, ideally software developers or UI/UX product designers, to
engage with -- and/or mentor -- our participants throughout our seven-month
program.

Our participants are determined, driven and committed to learning what's
required to get a job in the tech industry. They often have extensive experience
in other industries, and some have graduate degrees.

  started in tech, your current job, and what you look for when hiring people.

  your tech skills.
- Provide job prep advice such as mock interviews, resume review, job search
  tips, etc.
