## Full Stack Web<br>Development {#full-stack}

We will start from the basics of web development: HTML and CSS. Then we will
move into JavaScript as used in the browser, and then on the server.

No prior experience is needed as we will begin with the basics and progress
until you are able to develop complete web sites and applications on your own.

## Product Designer<br>UI/UX {#design}

Our Product Designer course is designed to give you the tools you need to gather requirements from users, do
customer research, and architect product solutions to solve end-user problems.

This is a hands-on course with practical product design experience. You will be
trained to use Figma, the industry standard interface-design tool to communicate
your designs to stakeholders and developers.
