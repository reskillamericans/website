## Full Stack Web<br>Development
We will start from the basics of web development: HTML and CSS. And
then move into JavaScript as used in the browser, and then on the
server.<br><br>No prior experience is needed as we will begin with the
basics and progress until you are able to develop complete web sites and
applications on your own.

## Product Designer<br>UI/UX

Our Product Designer course is designed to give you the tools you need to gather requirements from users, do
customer research, and architect product solutions to solve end-user problems.

This is a hands-on course with practical product design experience. You will be
trained to use Figma, the industry standard interface-design tool to communicate
your designs to stakeholders and developers.
