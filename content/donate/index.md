# Why Donate?

We rely on support from our donors in order to provide tuition-free software
development training to our participants: unemployed, underemployed and
career-changing underrepresented minorities.

When you donate to Reskill Americans, you help a determined, aspiring tech
professional get the skills they need to start a career in tech.

You're also helping create long-term economic advancement and a more equitable
future for all.
