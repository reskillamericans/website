Alex is a career changer that went from being a touring musician and music director, to becoming a full time software engineer. As a graduate of the first Reskill Americans cohort Alex brings valuable insight to the team, not only from a technical perspective as an engineer but as a former student. Alex handles many aspects of Reskill Americans, such as testing software before release and conducting reviews of the program to evaluate impact on participants. Alex also coordinates with other team members to manage Reskill American events, such as Demo Days, Town Halls, and mock interviews.

> As a former student I have always been passionate about the mission of Reskill Americans. I believe everyone is capable of having a career in tech if the resources are available. It is my passion to help others in their journey just as I was helped. I am excited to see the amazing impact racial minorities will continue to have in the tech sector as the world slowly embraces the power of diversity.
