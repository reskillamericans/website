Tim Mallalieu is the General Manager of Architecture for Azure Global at Microsoft, where he supports technical initiatives and architectural efforts across Azure’s portfolio. He has more than 27 years of experience in the tech industry, including 18 years at Microsoft, where he has primarily worked in the areas of Azure and Big Data, as well as in roles at three startup companies. In 1994, Tim founded an offshore development company called Net.kn, in St Kitts in the Caribbean, which delivered a turn-key hosted internet casino offering.

> I am mixed race: Black, White and Chinese, and I grew up in the Caribbean where educational opportunities were scarce. My mother was a teacher and my father was an electrical engineer; education was a priority to them. After graduating from college in the U.S., I returned to the Caribbean and was determined to help people in my community get ahead. So, I started a company that wrote software for internet casinos and e-commerce, and trained young talent who had no access to formal education but who had a passion for computers, programming or graphic design. Today, more than 20 years later, that initial team that I hired have all built successful careers in the tech industry.I joined the board of Reskill Americans because I want to give this same access – but on a much, much bigger scale – to our minority communities here in the U.S. I truly believe that our training model could “crack the code” on how to make software training accessible to anyone. My hope is that anyone who has a dream of working in technology will not only see that it is possible, but have confidence that one day, they can become role models for others.
