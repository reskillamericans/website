# Increasing Access to Careers<br>in Tech

Reskill Americans is a nonprofit founded by tech veterans that provides
tuition-free software development training, mentorship and community to
unemployed, underemployed and career-switching historically underrepresented
racial minorities across the U.S. to help them launch a career in tech.

We eliminate traditional barriers to access so that aspiring tech professionals
with no prior experience can enroll in our rigorous, instructorâ€“led online
program. Participants who complete our seven-month program will have applied
their new skills to software development projects, worked on cross-functional
teams, and built a portfolio of work to show future employers.
