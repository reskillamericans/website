# Increasing Access to Careers<br>in Tech

{{% /if-equal %}}


Reskill Americans is a nonprofit founded by tech veterans that provides
tuition-free software development training, mentorship and community to
unemployed, underemployed and career-switching historically underrepresented
racial minorities across the U.S. to help them launch a career in tech.

We eliminate traditional barriers to access so that aspiring tech professionals
with no prior experience can enroll in our rigorous, instructor–led online
program. Participants who complete our seven-month program will have applied
their new skills to software development projects, worked on cross-functional
teams, and built a portfolio of work to show future employers.

## A Conversation with our Co-Founder Femi Akinde

Watch Femi Akinde speak about why he felt an urgency to launch Reskill Americans and help create opportunities for what he calls “undrafted free agents” to get into the tech industry.  The video was filmed as part of Microsoft’s internal speaker series, Outside in, and also featured Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.
