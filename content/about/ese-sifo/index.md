Ese Sifo serves as the Global Director of Human Resources for Nordson Corporation where he is responsible for creating a people strategy that helps to drive business objectives for the company. He also serves as Talent & HR Advisor to Reskill Americans. Ese began his career in finance but quickly pivoted to Human Resources after he identified a need for corporations to attract, develop and engage diverse talent and promote inclusive and equitable practices in the work place to afford minorities a chance at career development and progression. In his spare time, Ese coaches young adults with medical complications who are looking to grow their career objectives and fulfill their purpose. Ese is passionate about this project given his own struggles with Sickle Cell Anemia while rising in his professional career to leadership positions.

> I believe that a career in tech is key to the future. I have two boys who I am trying to prepare for the future workforce. I’m passionate about the mission of Reskill Americans because I want to help create a path for people like me who might not necessarily get access to an education in tech so that ultimately, all communities have a seat at the table in tech industry.
