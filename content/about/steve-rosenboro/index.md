> I was reared by three strong-willed African American women - my grandmother, my mother, and my aunt. While my grandmother was functionally illiterate, she was the hardest working person I ever encountered. She encouraged my aunt to earn a Master of Education from Columbia University in 1953, and my aunt encouraged me and hundreds of young students to pursue our goals. Education reoriented the trajectory of my family: it moved us away from washing clothes and scrubbing floors for families in Augusta, Georgia and toward building equity in New York City. Creating career pathways in tech enables me to help thousands of racial minorities change the trajectory of their lives and the lives of future generations. <br><br/>
> Everyone that has achieved any measurable success was supported by a team of people. Reskill Americans has a tremendous opportunity to help thousands of historically underrepresented racial minorities achieve their higher purpose in life through education, mentoring, allyship, and relationship building. Hundreds of people supported my journey, and I am excited to work with Reskill Americans to support others with their journeys.
