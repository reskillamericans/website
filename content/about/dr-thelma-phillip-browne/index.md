> I was born in a chattel house (a small moveable wooden house that existed in former British Caribbean island colonies) in a poor neighborhood, and learned that education is the avenue to exit poverty. I have always been a proponent of education and embrace the 6 Cs of education: creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, connectivity, community, and culture. I believe preparation for a career in tech embraces all of these crucial elements. I believe that every individual was imbued by the Creator with unique gifts that must be nurtured and nuanced for the benefit not just of that person but for the sustainability of man and his environment. Reskill Americans is an opportunity for people to bond together in the spirit of ubuntu to propel the world towards reducing inequality and promoting inclusive economic growth â€” two core goals of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. It all starts with one person learning from another!
