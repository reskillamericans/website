  Pamela Price is a passionate STEM educator who has worked for more two decades in academics and more than one decade in tech. After 15 years working at various Silicon Valley companies ranging from startups to multinationals, Pamela started a second career in teaching, helping students develop a strong foundation in programming concepts. For the last 20 years, she has worked as a Computer Science Professor at Mills College, College of San Mateo, Ohlone College, and DeVry University. Her expertise is teaching all levels of programming, in particular Java and C++. Most recently, Pamela founded Jumpstart Code, which develops YouTube content that makes complex coding concepts easy to understand. She has also worked with Girls Who Code as an instructor in their Summer Immersion Program. She loves to inspire the learning process and help students at all levels develop a love of coding. Her education includes a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Rice University and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.

  > In order to create technology that benefits all people, we need a diversity of viewpoints in the tech industry. Throughout my education and career, I’ve often been the only minority and/or woman in the room. When I became a teacher, it bothered me that women and people of color continued to be underrepresented in the classroom. Typical academic paths and bootcamps haven’t always been open and accessible to underrepresented minorities and women. Reskill Americans is changing that. A background in technology can open doors to many careers, not just software development and coding. I believe in the power of education to change lives, and I am passionate about being a mentor and role model to show others what is possible. Together, we can change the future of tech.
