  > Tech provides an opportunity for creativity and ideas to reach masses and influence everything from how we work to how we are entertained. Having people from all backgrounds develop the skills to contribute to these creations will improve and enhance their quality and relatability. A career in tech can provide a livable wage, but it can also provide opportunities to earn generational wealth. I am committed to helping as many organizations as possible that want to make a real impact on diversity, equality, and inclusion. Reskill American’s unique and noble approach is refreshing, and I am sure it will be effective in changing the trajectory of many lives.
