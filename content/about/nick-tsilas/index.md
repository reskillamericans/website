> Equity and social justice are fundamental principles of our democracy. However, systemic racism and economic inequality have created real barriers and excluded minorities from opportunities, including educational and professional opportunities in tech. I’ve seen and benefited firsthand from the power of one student, one keyboard and lines of code that can change the world. I’m passionate about Reskill American’s mission to level the playing field and provide opportunities to underrepresented minorities. The next Bill Gates will be a minority. And if we’re a little lucky, who knows, they may even be someone that was motivated by Reskill Americans.
