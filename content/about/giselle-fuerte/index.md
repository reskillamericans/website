Giselle Fuerte is a learning and development professional with nearly three decades of experience primarily working in the technology sector.

>Over three decades ago, I started my career as an instructor at a computer training school in Alaska where I taught computer basics, office applications, and résumé-writing and interviewing skills to learners from primarily Indigenous backgrounds. Teaching in small classrooms and working with my students in a career development mentor capacity allowed me to get to know my students’ circumstances and journeys, and to operate as a ferryman, figuratively speaking, helping them to reach the next milestone in their life.

>Now at Reskill Americans, I get to be party to this same virtuous work and weighty responsibility, but at considerable scale. By training as many underrepresented racial minorities in technology as we can, we facilitate a chain reaction: ultimately, our graduates will not only transform their own lives, they will also transform the tech sector and everything it touches.
