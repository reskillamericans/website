In her current role with Reskill Americans, Lorraine manages content creation, outreach, brand messaging, and participant communications.

> I am passionate about creating opportunities that have traditionally not been equally available to all segments of society. Reskill Americans provided me with the tools I needed to transition into a new career and I am motivated to help others do the same. I am excited to be a part of an organization that provides the resources to make this a reality for others.
