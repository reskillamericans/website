On Monday, June 7th, as participants started the Project Phase (Phase II) of our program, we hosted our 13th Town Hall with SoftwareONE employees Nina Unger, Talent Acquisition Partner, and Bill Winans, Regional Director.    

SoftwareONE is a global cloud software management and consulting company that created a 12-week training program, SoftwareONE Academy, to develop and recruit new talent into the firm. Nina and Bill shared details about the Academy, which is an apprenticeship program for entry-level technologists that seek additional training to launch their careers.   

Bill explained that because the software reseller is now pivoting into the professional services business, they’re seeing a “meteoric rise” in their technology service groups. “We want to find people  who can show base-level capabilities, and then we will upskill them ourselves.” The company is looking to recruit people that are eager to build their tech careers, starting in entry-level positions.   

The Academy has hired more than 20 people to date and aims to hire several thousand people across four different countries (including the U.S.). “We want to tap into nontraditional educational programs and leave no stone unturned in finding good talent and smart people,” Bill said. SoftwareONE will recruit people in different tracks and then pair them with a mentor in that area of specialization.  

Nina Unger, Talent Acquisition Partner said that the Academy is the bridge between someone’s existing training/education, and SoftwareONE’s on-the-job training.   

  

People who are recruited for the Academy will be paid an hourly wage for the first 6 weeks while completing the internship portion of the Academy.  In these first 6 weeks, there is hands-on training to upskill them to prepare for the full 12-week Academy program. Upon successful completion of the internship, they have the choice to continue into the 12- week intensive training program. Upon successful completion of the 12 weeks of training and certification, they have the opportunity to continue to work full-time as an associate and receive an annual salary (of $50,000) and full benefits.  After the first 12 months, they are eligible for a salary increase and to become bonus eligible. “We want you to find your home here, enjoy what you’re doing, and be here for a while,” said Nina.  

The next Academy programs being in November 2021 and January 2022.   

SoftwareONE is headquartered in Switzerland and has a presence in over 90 countries, including five offices in the U.S. (and a U.S. headquarters in Wisconsin). The company has more than 7,700 employees and most of them work remotely.
