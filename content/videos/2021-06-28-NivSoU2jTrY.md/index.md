On Monday June 28th, we invited Tony Wright, CEO, entrepreneur and UI/UX designer to speak at our Town Hall. Tony, CEO of Rescue Time, has a long career as an entrepreneur, founding numerous startups, including through the famed Y-Combinator startup incubator.  He shared details about his career progression, the importance of good design in product development and company success, as well as inspiring tips on how to master new skills and develop routines. 

“The doing is where the learning is,” Tony said. “Getting armpit deep in designing is the best way to learn and also the most fun way to learn.”
