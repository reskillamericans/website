Join us for our 16th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

We've gotten several requests to have a guest to represent the product design and UI/UX career path.  So,  our guest this week is a long-time friend, Tony Wright.  Tony started his career as a web designing and small business owner.  He's had a long career as an entrepreneur founding numerous Start Ups include through the famed Y-Combinator start-up incubator.

We will be discussing how Tony got his career progression as well as the importance of good design in product development and company success.  We'll also get his thoughts on navigating opportunities as a small-business owner and start-up founder.
