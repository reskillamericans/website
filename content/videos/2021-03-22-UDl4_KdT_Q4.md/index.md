Join us for our 3nrd Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.  Last week you got information on choosing a Track, which many of you should have done by now.  And your first assignments are due this week.

Today's presenters are Michael Lehenbauer and Chelsi Asulin from the CovidActNow.org team.  CovidActNow is a modern web application which was designed to help promote better public health decisions during the pandemic by showing real health metrics across every state and county in the US.  The team consisted of many volunteers and paid staff.  Chelsi was a recent bootcamp graduate herself, and she will describe how it felt to be thrown into the deep end on such an ambitious project.

We will be taking questions in Slack (on our #town-hall-questions channel).  And you'll be invited to join our Zoom call to ask questions in person at the end of the meeting.

Thanks for joining us!
