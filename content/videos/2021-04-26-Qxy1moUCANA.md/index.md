Join us for our 8th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Our guest speakers will be from the BlackRock Financial company.  We will get a look at how software development skills can be applied in the financial sector.  BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with over $8 trillion under management.
