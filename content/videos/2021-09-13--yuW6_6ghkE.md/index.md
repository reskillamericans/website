On September 13th, we chatted with Danielle (Dani) Storlie, Senior Director of Design at Procore Technologies, a construction management software company. Dani has worked for more than a decade in software design, including at Sonos and Deloitte Digital, and consulted for early-stage startup and fortune 500 brands while at Deloitte such as Target, Amazon, and FoxSports.  

Dani spoke about her career path, shared interview and resume tips, and discussed what companies look for when evaluating design candidates. “Everyone wants a really good candidate experience because that’s also a reflection of the business and the culture,” Dani said. “So even though an interview can be intimidating, just be yourself because that’s the most important thing.”
