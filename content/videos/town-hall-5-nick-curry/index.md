Join us for our 5th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Our guest speaker is Nick Curry - head of Diversity Interships at Amazon Web Services.  Nick and I will talk about how AWS runs its internship program, how our participants can qualify, and we'll take questions from those interested.

We will be taking questions in Slack (on our #town-hall-questions channel).  And you'll be invited to join our Zoom call to ask questions in person at the end of the meeting.

Thanks for joining us!
