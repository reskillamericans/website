Join us for our 4th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.  This is the beginning of the second week of real class work.

We will devote the majority of this time to Q&A and getting feedback on how things are going in your courses.

We will be taking questions in Slack (on our #town-hall-questions channel).  And you'll be invited to join our Zoom call to ask questions in person at the end of the meeting.

Thanks for joining us!
