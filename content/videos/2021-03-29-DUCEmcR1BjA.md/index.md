On Monday, March 29th, we hosted our weekly fourth Town Hall for participants in our software development training program.  Participants just completed their first week of learning about the program and so we dedicated the entire session to taking questions from them.  Mike Koss, CTO; Seyi Onifade, instructor and Senior Software Developer Team Lead of HNG Tech/Zuri; and Juwon Isola-Osobu, Director of Program Management, managed and addressed questions.
