Join us for our 12th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Our guest speaker will be Kedasha Kerr.  Kedasha has made the jump from bootcamp to full time developer at a mid-west insurance company.  But she's also sharing her knowledge and experience on social media for other who are on a similar journey.
