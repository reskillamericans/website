If you've never built any kind of web page before, the terms HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be a little confusing.  In this demo, I show what those three languages do, and how you can use them to create a simple application in a web page.

There is a typo in closing the body tag.  I should have written /body to close it (I left out the slash).  Note that most browsers are lenient with dealing with bugs like this. They try their best to figure out what you meant if you have an error.  Thanks, Jim, for pointing this out.
