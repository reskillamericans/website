Join us for our 8th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Our guest will be Eric Johnson, Director in Innovation at Bright Machines.   He will speak about growing need for technology skills in the manufacturing industry.  Eric is focused on developing technologies for software-defined automation. With two decades of experience as a mechanical engineer, he’s worked on a range of challenges, including world-first products at Google and Mojo Vision. Johnson’s interest in using modern manufacturing technology to transform an industry began when he co-founded Skyline Solar, and it continues to drive his work today.
