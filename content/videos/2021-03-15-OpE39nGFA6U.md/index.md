Join us for our 2nd Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.  This week your course work begins.  We have a guest speaker joining us that many of you already know from YouTube - Jeremiah Peoples.  We'll be talking to him about his journey to becoming a Software Engineer and his advice for those just getting started.

We will be taking questions in YouTube chat as well as inviting anyone that wants to join us in Zoom at the end of the Town Hall for live Q&A.

Thanks for joining us!
