Join us for our 7th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Our guest speaker will be Deborah Russell, from the Workforce Investment Council, a national governmental organization that provides people with job resources to help them enter the workforce.  Deborah is the Associate Director of Performance and Impact at the WIC in D.C. and has 20 years of experience helping Americans fulfill their employment and career goals. She will give an overview that includes how WIC provides career pathways for people coming out of training programs (like Reskill Americans), and how you can access the programâ€™s career resources in your state.
