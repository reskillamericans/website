On July 12th, we spoke with Mike Coleman who works for Google Cloud as a developer advocate where he’s focused on helping to inspire people to do amazing things with Google Cloud's technology. Prior to his current role, he was at Amazon Web Services, and has also worked at Microsoft, VMware, Intel, HP, as well as a couple of startups (Docker and Puppet).  

Mike spoke about the benefits of choosing his career path, his role as a developer advocate, the skills required for the job, and his career progression.  “Building your personal brand – creating blog posts, creating YouTube videos, sharing your knowledge journey – it is a great way to get into a role like this, to give back to a community, and become engrained in part of the community.”
