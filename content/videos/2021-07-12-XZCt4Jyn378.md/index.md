Join us for our 17th Town Hall meeting of the 2021 class of Reskill Americans.

Mike and I will talk about a somewhat different role in tech - that of a developer advocate, requiring both excellent technical knowledge and communication skills.  We'll talk about the benefits of this as a career path, and what type of person this job would most appeal to.
