On September 27th, Teddy Buriss, a LinkedIn Strategist, Trainer and Coach, hosted a Job Fair for our participants about using LinkedIn as a career transition tool. Teddy’s offered tips and insights for ways to leverage LinkedIn to help your job search and career transition and shared some of best practices for building a professional LinkedIn Profile, a relevant LinkedIn Network, and building a professional brand on LinkedIn.  

“Are you moving the right connections into meaningful and relevant conversations that can move you into a conversation focused on your career?” Teddy asked participants. “At the end of the day, it’s all about moving the right people into the right conversations.”
