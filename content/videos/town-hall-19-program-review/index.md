As most teams have completed their Phase II work, we are entering a new phase of our program.  We will talk about what we hope to accomplish in preparing you for successful job interviews, and scheduling 1:1 assessment meetings for everyone.

Juwon and I will also be taking questions and getting feedback about how to focus our remaining time together.
