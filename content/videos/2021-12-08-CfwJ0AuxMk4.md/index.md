In October 2021, 130 bright, determined, and entrepreneurial participants completed the Reskill Americans inaugural 2021 software development training program. On December 7, we hosted a Final Demo Day as an opportunity for a few of our participants to showcase their projects so that the tech community could learn a bit more about our program and our participant base.
