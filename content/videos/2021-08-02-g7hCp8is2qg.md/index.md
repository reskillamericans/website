As we entered the ninth week of the Project Phase of our program, our 18th Town Hall featured two leaders in software at Sonos, Inc: Andrew Kwatinetz, Director of Software Product, and Eric Patey, Senior Director.  Andrew is an experienced product leader who has worked at both start-ups and tech giants, and Eric has 30 years of experience building and leading high power software development teams. They spoke about the software and hardware behind Sonos products and what they love about the company, and shared details about their career paths and the skills they look for when hiring people. 

“The opportunities are so vast to find a technology that turns you on,” said Eric when asked for what he looks for in a candidate. “Go contribute to that in the open source world. You can learn from the community and make contributions to the community, and when I see someone doing that, it’s so impactful for me.”
