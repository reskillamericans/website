As we enter the ninth week of the Project Phase of our program, our 18th Town Hall will feature two leaders in software at Sonos, Inc: Andrew Kwatinetz, Director of Software Product, and Eric Patey, Senior Director.  Andrew is an experienced product leader who has worked at both start-ups and tech giants, and Eric has 30 years of experience building and leading high power software development teams. They will speak about their backgrounds, the skills they look for when hiring people for their teams, and a new software project they run together at Sonos.
