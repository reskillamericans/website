### 29. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. 
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.

>##### 29.1 Generally. 
>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Reskill and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of RA Training and the Reskill Offerings or these Terms of Service ("Dispute") will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:

>>##### 29.1.1 Notice of Dispute. 
>>In the event of a Dispute, you or Reskill must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a "Notice of Dispute"). You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S. Mail to Reskill Americans, 5608 17th Ave. NW Ste 619, Seattle, WA 98107 and also via e-mail to info@reskillamericans.org. Reskill will send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class U.S. Mail to your address if Reskill has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address indicated in your enrollment application. You and Reskill will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or Reskill may commence arbitration.
>>##### 29.1.2 Binding Arbitration. 

>>Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Reskill may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 29. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. The place of arbitration shall be Seattle, Washington. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
>> ##### 29.1.3 Class Action Waiver. 

>>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Reskill will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.


>>##### 29.1.4 Arbitration Procedures. 

>>Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect at the time the Dispute is filed. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Reskill and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
>>##### 29.1.5 Arbitration Fees. 

>>Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If Reskill files, then Reskill will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. Each party will bear the expense of that party's attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.

>>##### 29.1.6 Filing Period. 

>>To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur. If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.
>> ##### 29.1.7 Venue. 
>>In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 29, you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for King County, Washington, and you and Reskill hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action. Notwithstanding this, Reskill (including its contractors and vendors) shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce their respective intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### 30. Severability. 

If any provision of the Terms of Service or any Guideline is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms of Service or the applicable Guideline to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
### 31. Assignment. 

The Terms of Service and Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Reskill’s prior written consent, but may be assigned by Reskill without consent or any restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms of Service shall be null and void.

### 32. Survival. 

Upon expiration or termination of these Terms of Service or the RA Training, or following your termination from the RA Training for any reason, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 5 through 11, 13, 14, and 17 through 34.

### 33. Headings. 

The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms of Service, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

### 34. Entire Agreement. 
These Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy and Guidelines constitute the entire agreement between you and Reskill relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or Guidelines made by Reskill as set forth in Sections 6 or 7 above.
