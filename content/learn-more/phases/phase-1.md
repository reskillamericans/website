## Skills Building

### (12 weeks)

In this phase, we focus on project-based learning: we define a series of projects that you will need to complete in order to demonstrate your mastery of newly-acquired skills.

## Web Development

If you enroll in the Web Development Track, you will learn everything you need
to know about creating web sites and applications. We begin with the basics of
HTML and CSS, and you'll build your first web page projects.

We then continue on to in-depth instruction in the JavaScript programming
language. As before, we rely heavily on (fun) projects along the way to help
cement concepts and build your confidence

Finally, we move to the back-end and learn how to implement a web application
server by implementing data storage and user authentication.

By this time you'll be ready to build a complete web application.

## Product Design

If you enroll in the Product Design Track, we begin with the basics of
user interaction and design: how to build web or mobile applications that are
easy to understand and that present information clearly.

Designers also have projects to work on. You will be given customer problems,
and be asked to do independent research and case studies. From there you will
formulate a design from wire-framing through high-fidelity prototypes.

You will have extensive practice using the user-interface design app, Figma, to
communicate your designs to stakeholders and developers.
