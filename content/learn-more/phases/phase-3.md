As a final project, you will be grouped into teams to work on a project
together.  In this phase, we will integrate our Product Design and Web
Development tracks.

You will be responsible for keeping your team on track and for defining your
goals and milestones; you will have weekly mentor check-ins to help if you get
stuck.

We will ask each team to present their finished projects at a series of Demo Day
events to cap off the program.

***All participants who successfully complete these Phase 3 projects will be
issued a Certificate of Completion in Web Development or in Product Design.***
