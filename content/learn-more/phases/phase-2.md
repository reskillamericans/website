## Individual Project

### (6 weeks)

{{% image-box src="Phase-1.png" resize="800x" %}}

In Phase 2, you will take everything you've learned from the classroom,
exercises, and small projects in Phase I and apply it to an individual project.

Your final individual project must be a complete hosted application.  We will
work with you to suggest a project, or help you to define your own.

Each project must include user authentication, user-provided data, use of a
server-side database, and web hosting. This project should be an excellent
addition to your portfolio to show to potential employers.

***We require completion of an individual project before assigning you to a
project team in Phase&nbsp;3.***
