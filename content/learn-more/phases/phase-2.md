As a final project, you will be paired into teams to work on a project together.In this phase, we’ll integrate our UI/UX Design and Full-Stack Web Development tracks to form multidisciplinary project teams.


You will collaborate with your team, creating goals together and helping each other stay aligned to project deadlines to ensure success. 

You’ll have weekly mentor meetings to address challenges. Each team will present their finished projects at a series of Demo Day events to cap off the Phase.

***Graduates will receive a certificate of completion in either Full-Stack Web Development or UX/UI Design and then can join the Reskill Americans Apprenticeship Program to hone their skills in a real-world environment.***
