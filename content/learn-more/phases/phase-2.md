As a final project, you will be paired into teams to work on a project together. In this phase, we will integrate our Product Design and Web Development tracks.

You will be responsible for keeping your team on track and for defining your goals and milestones; you will have weekly mentor check-ins to help you get unblocked.

We will ask each team to present their finished projects at a series of Demo Day events to cap off the program.

***All participants who successfully complete these Phase II projects will be issued a Certificate of Completion in Web Development or in Product Design.***
