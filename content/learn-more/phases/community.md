### (throughout the program)

Although delivered online, our program is designed to be social.  You will be
paired with mentors and TAs from the beginning, and matched with a group of
participants at your level. You will also have the opportunity to engage with
industry experts.

Here are a few examples of our ongoing community support:

- Weekly Town Hall live-streams with industry professionals and former
  participants that have successfully completed our training program.
- Access to office hours with mentors and TAs when you need individual support.
- Coding challenges: get practice solving coding problems that you might
  confront in an interview or job application.
- Online discussion boards to communicate with other participants in real-time.
