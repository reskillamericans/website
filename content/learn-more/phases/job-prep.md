## Getting Your First Job or Internship

### (ongoing)

Throughout every phase of our program, we will work with you each week on your
job preparedness skills.  We will host weekly Town Hall meetings with experts
from the tech industry, as well as Job Fairs with employers interested in our
participants.

We will also provide training in how to write an effective resume and LinkedIn
profile, and how to promote your work on GitHub.

And finally, we will offer training sessions on the technical interview process,
and will offer mock interviews with experienced developers and designers.

After seven months, our training program will end, but our job-prep support will
continue: our resources will still be available to you, and we will help
introduce you to recruiters and to relevant opportunities.
