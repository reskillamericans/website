## Self-Paced Orientation

### (approximately 4 weeks)

{{% image-box src="Working_01.png" resize="800x" %}}

Everyone comes to our program from a range of industries and experiences, and
we've found that your diverse backgrounds can enhance your collective training.
In our Intro Phase, you will be paired with a small group of your peers with
complementary backgrounds in a "learning pod" to get to each other.

This Phase is designed to familiarize you with the tools and the materials that
we'll be studying later.  This is also a good time to confirm your track.

Not sure whether you even want to be a software developer? Our Intro Phase will
help you figure that out!

***You must actively participate in this phase to proceed to Phase I.***
