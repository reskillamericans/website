As a first-generation student there can sometimes be a lack of guidance when it
comes to education and career choices. I donâ€™t think I have ever come across any
boot camp program that can be labeled as empathetic but that is one trait that
definitely makes Reskill Americans stand out. Although the workload can be
intense at times and there are deadlines to abide by, the sense of community is
amazing and encouraging. It has left me with the confidence that I can
transition to a successful career in the tech industry.
