The mentors at Reskill are amazing and really care about the outcomes of each student. I keep seeing students from my cohort getting amazing jobs. I would encourage anyone interested in a career in software development to join Reskill Americans. I would even say that if you are self-taught, there is still a ton of value to get from the program, especially involving working with teams and getting access to mentors. I have taken a full-time position as a Software Developer for Sandals Church.
