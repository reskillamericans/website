This program has helped me become more proficient with HTML and CSS, as well as
implementing responsive design. I was also able to learn more about the basics
of JavaScript and created my first hamburger menu using the skills I learned
during this program. Thank you Reskill Americans for this great experience, I
learned so much since I started this program 7 months ago. It was a lot of hard
work but the experience gained, was definitely worth it.
