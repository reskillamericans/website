When I think about where I was last March and where I am now as a Frontend Web
Developer, it’s like night and day: I went from learning basic Git from Mike
Koss to running my own project. It’s been a wonderful journey. Don’t get me
wrong, it was difficult, but well worth it.  I am humbled by and thankful for
the experience.

We were taught by a dedicated team of instructors and mentors and were given
unfiltered access to board members. Throughout the program, we were pushed to
work hard and encouraged to do it as a community.
