I recently accepted a six-figure offer as a Software Engineer II for Walmart Labs -- the same title given at my company to new graduates with four-year CS degrees! Reskill Americans is where I first learned to code, created my first "Hello World,‚Äù and pushed my first lines to GitHub. I would never have even gotten started if not for this amazing bootcamp.
