Reskill Americans provided me with the opportunity to gain foundational programming skills. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and React as a Frontend Developer. I created multiple individual projects, scaled applications to mobile screens, worked and built applications with cross-functional developers, and deployed these applications to Git. Reskill Americans is an amazing opportunity and I would highly recommend individuals interested in the tech industry who have zero-to-little experience to join. Not only is it free, which you do not find in a curriculum very often, but the instructors are very knowledgeable, and the network you gain with like-minded peers is a wonderful space to be a part of.

I am extremely thankful to have come across Reskill Americans as it allowed me to gain the skills to jump start my journey into the tech world: I'm now a Software Engineer at JP Morgan Chase!
