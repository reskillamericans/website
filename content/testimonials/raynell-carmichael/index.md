The best part about the program is the community. You meet like-minded
individuals from all professional backgrounds who are kind and helpful. I never
once felt like I couldn’t get through the program because of all the support
that’s available. If you are looking to get into the industry, and learning the
fundamentals that can set a strong foundation on your journey into tech, sign up
right away. I entered the program knowing nothing, and left with a portfolio and
knowledge that pointed me into the right direction. Two months after the
program, I got a paid internship at a startup called Lucinetic.
