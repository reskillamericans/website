This program has helped me find my path in technology. Prior to this program
I've taken classes in front end and back end development however I never felt
they were the right match for me. When I received the opportunity to participate
in this program I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to learn
UI/UX Design. Through this program I was able to learn new skills and genuinely
gain a passion for design. I am excited for my future.
